## Description
LifePath is a mobile application that gives users a more personalized photo memories experience by creating audio-video recommendations, organizing usersâ€™ photo libraries, and filtering collections together based on metadata in the photos. It is an easier way to access, share, create, and save specific memories without the hassle of having to skim through countless blurry or irrelevant photos. Lifepath uses the power of Artificial Intelligence to help get the audio-video recommendations and albums based on locations, faces, dates, and more.
